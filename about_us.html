            <p>According to UNICEF (2018), GenZ worldwide has the highest rate of diagnosed depression and reported
                anxiety among the generations. This statistics for Vietnamese adolescents falls between 8% and 29%,
                differing among provinces and genders. Recent years show an increase number of teenagers suffering from
                mental disorders or... “suddenly” choosing to “log out of Earth” due to various unfortunate reasons...
                As members of said generation who has felt sincere heart-breaks reading about their peers’ incidents
                along with witness their own relatives suffering, 3 of us - the Hydro team has decided to put our heart
                and effort into developing Mi Casa.</p>
            <p>Mi Casa’s vision is to help everyone who seeks to improve their mental health, first our own Vietnamese
                people, and later anyone around the world. We want to provide a safe space for you to come to share,
                heal, spread love, understanding and sympathy to anyone who needs it. We want you to know that you are
                not alone, and there are those who are like you out there, and those who really want to understand and
                help. Together, we could find a cure, and heal, and grow. You will not have to go through anything alone
                again because we are here now!</p>

                    <p>Nguyen Anh Minh is currently taking her last course at RMIT as well as doing an internship at a
                        start-up logistics provider. Anh Minh and Minh Anh together gave birth to the idea of Mi Casa.
                        She is also the main Front-end developer and User Experience Designer for Mi Casa.</p>
                    <p>In her free time, she would go out for a walk or bike-ride, play open-world action games, listen
                        to music, or play jigsaw puzzles.
                    </p>
                    <p>Through her studying and working experiences, she has learnt how technology could greatly
                        facilitate business operations and the supply chain specifically, along with leverage the stand
                        of a firm towards competitors. Consequently, Minh becomes fascinated in exploring how IT can be
                        utilised to optimise a supply chain. In the past, she was taught Pascal in secondary school.
                        Furthermore, she once tried to study C++ but due to the low possibility of realistic application
                        in her intended career path, she gave it up to make time for supply chain studies.</p>

                        Digital Marketer focusing on the Social Media segment. Minh Anh is the main User Interface
                        Designer who has the most credit for the visual design of Mi Casa.</p>
                    <p>Her hobbies are reading books, surfing and learning from the internet, listening to music, doing
                        nail art and drawing.
                    </p>
                    <p>She has interest in IT since she is currently keen on building websites, applications and IT
                        trends that can be applied into marketing. Minh Anh has some basic understanding about IT
                        applications and used to try learning Python but since it is not really relevant to her major,
                        she did not have any chances to apply it into any project.</p>

                    <p>Trinh Duc Duy is a senior student majoring in Logistics & Supply Chain Management, who loves
                        exploring new innovative things, especially technology. Duy is in charge of reporting the team’s
                        progress and contributes greatly in the coding process of Mi Casa.</p>
                    <p>His hobbies are doing individual sports, travelling, and coming up with new ideas in doing
                        everyday activities, including both work & life.
                    </p>
                    <p>During the study journey at RMIT and his internship experiences at 3 different companies, he has
                        observed the importance of IT in the success of businesses. </p>
                    <p>In fact, IT is involved in every stage of the supply chain, from raw-material acquisition to the
                        final distribution to customers. Although IT is not his major, He has researched some of the
                        most prominent IT trends, such as big data, IOTs, AI, advanced robotics, and blockchain, but has
                        not participated in any IT project before. For the expectation in this course, Duy hopes to
                        learn more about the process of IT application development, and the fundamentals of how IT is
                        utilised in daily life.
